**1976**:    My father started the company after leaving another national Business Forms company.

His Niche was Pegboard Accounting Systems (also known as One-write systems) as well as Business Forms

**1980**:    Early 80’s he expanded into 1 & 2-color Offset printing.   This would cover your basic Stationery Needs, Envelopes & Business Cards, etc. *The beginning of providing total Print solutions to Businesses.

**1985:**    I joined the company in the Mid-1980’s in Sales

**1987:**    We got our first Desktop Publishing computer & software. Up to this point we were making artboards by hand, cutting & pasting. Or doing designs on Graph paper and handing them off to a typesetter.

*This was out start into eventually full graphic design capabilities for print

**1990**:    Early 90’s we expanded into Full color Commercial Printing & Direct mail printing/services  *This was a natural progression to offer complete printing solutions for our clients.

**1997**:    We hired our first professional Graphic Designer.  This really helped us continue to expand into marketing driven print solutions, especially full color printing.  Also starting to expand our creative services to Logo design, etc.

**2000**:    Early 2000’s we added our Promotional Products & decorated Apparel line.  This was really in response to what our clients kept asking for.  It now made us a complete Marketing solution for printing & branded products for our business clients.

This also was in direct response to what we had been seeing for years – How technology & software was replacing Traditional Business forms.

*Which we still provide business forms to this day for several clients.  There still is a need for specialty forms today

**2003**:    We moved to new location in Norton Ohio.  This allowed us to expand into warehousing for some of our larger print users

**2013**:    This was the year we did our first Full Wrap. Up to this point we had dabbled some in providing vehicle graphics for a few clients but nothing steady.  The light bulb went on that this was a perfect fit for our Team and for our Clients.

*I had been asking myself for years how do we keep a focus on “Relationships” with our clients? We don’t want to compete with low price online print sources where you can just price shop and there is no value, or loyalty.

That is not to say our prices are not competitive. We would not have lasted 49 years if they were not.  We just wanted to shift away from being involved in just “commodity” type print, as the industry keeps changing.

Large Graphics (or large format printing) is what rounded our product line with the emphasis on our Professional design services and now our expert Installation

**2016**:    We moved to our current location here in Wadsworth OH.  This gave us plenty of room for growth in our team and for our expanding Vehicle Wrap business & warehousing footprint.

I thought we would never outgrow the space we have currently….

**2025**:    Today we are just now completing another 10,000 SF addition to our shop here in Wadsworth.  This will give us 3 Full sized Installation bays for our growing Fleet Graphics & Vehicle wrapping division.
