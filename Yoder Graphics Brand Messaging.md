## **Value Propositions**

### **1. Business-Critical Execution**

**What it means:** We handle the work that can't be wrong — the fleet that represents you on every highway, the materials that go in front of your biggest clients, the brand presence that wins you commercial contracts.

**Use when:** Talking to prospects with high-stakes needs (fleet wraps, large orders, brand-sensitive work)

**Example copy:**

> *Your trucks are on the road every day. Your signs are the first thing customers see. Your materials go in front of decision-makers. This isn't commodity work — it's your reputation. We treat it that way.*
> 

---

### **2. Obsessive Brand Consistency**

**What it means:** Color matching across mediums, highly professional design, right materials, right process. From your business cards to your semi trailers, everything matches. Everything is right.

**Use when:** Differentiating from quick-print shops or online services

**Example copy:**

> *We match colors across substrates. We proof everything. We sweat the details you didn't know existed — because when your fleet pulls up next to your trade show booth, they should look like they came from the same company.*
> 

---

### **3. One Team, Full Range**

**What it means:** Design, wraps, print, promo, fulfillment — all under one roof. One team that knows your brand handles everything. No re-explaining. No inconsistency between vendors.

**Use when:** Talking to businesses frustrated by vendor juggling or brand inconsistency

**Example copy:**

> *Most businesses work with one company for printing, another for wraps, another for promo. Then wonder why nothing matches. We handle it all — one team that knows your brand inside and out.*
> 

---

### **4. Reliable at Scale**

**What it means:** Large orders, delivered on time, brand-perfect every time. Common jobs and oddball requests. Companies trust us because we're always here and reliable.

**Use when:** Talking to fleet managers, marketing directors with recurring needs

**Example copy:**

> *We've wrapped power company fleets and fire departments. Outfitted entire sales teams. Handled the weird requests nobody else wanted to touch. Large or small, standard or rare— delivered right, on time.*
> 

---

### **5. 50 Years of Adaptation**

**What it means:** Started in business forms in 1976. Added offset printing, digital design, full-color commercial printing, promo products, vehicle wraps — each because clients needed it. Still here. Still growing. Just added 10,000 SF.

**Use when:** Building trust, establishing credibility, countering "fly by night" competitors

**Example copy:**

> *We started when business forms were carbon copy. We've outlasted trends, technologies, and competitors by doing one thing: delivering what our clients need, when they need it. Fifty years later, we're still here — and just expanded to keep up with demand.*
>

When talking to specific verticals, use their language:

| **Industry** | **Language to Use** |

## **Objection Responses**

| **Objection** | **Response Angle** |
| --- | --- |
| "You're more expensive than [online printer]" | "We're not competing with commodity printers. We're for businesses where the work has to be right — where a mismatched Pantone or bubbling wrap costs more than the savings." |
| "Can't we just do lettering instead of a full wrap?" | "Absolutely. We'll help you figure out what makes sense for your goals and budget. Sometimes lettering is the right call. Sometimes a partial wrap gets you 80% of the impact at 50% of the cost." |
| "We've been burned by vendors before" | "That's exactly why clients stick with us. One team, one point of contact, and we don't disappear after the sale. We've been here 50 years — we're not going anywhere." |
| "We're not sure what we need" | "That's fine. Most clients don't know exactly what they need when they call. We'll figure it out together." |
