intro:
  - "The materials that go in front of decision-makers need to represent you professionally. Business cards, brochures, presentation folders, direct mail — these aren't commodity items. They're your reputation in print."
  - "We've been doing commercial printing since 1980 — long before digital made everyone a \"printer.\" We understand paper stocks, color matching, and what it takes to make printed materials that look right and last."
